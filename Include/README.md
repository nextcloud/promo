We generally get 45mm circular outdoor stickers: https://www.flyeralarm.com/de/shop/configurator/index/quantity/7983970#159=601&160=602&161=615&162=585


There are 3 files for each sticker:

- **.svg as source:** Has the full black background, you can just remove that to see the circular black background.
- **-mockup.png:** Just as a demo how the sticker would look like (see above).
- **.jpg for printing (300dpi, 100% quality):** Done via export of the SVG to PNG via Inkscape and then to JPG via GIMP. Yes this is not CMYK as thatâ€™s not supported in GIMP but Iâ€™ve been doing all stickers like that and it has been fine. If you know how to do it in CMYK, the source file is there and Iâ€™d love to know how. :)
